    "# Capstone Project Proposal\n",
    "## Housing price prediction - How a real-estate expert can help improving a model\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is the problem you want to solve ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Many people attempt to predict the housing price using ML. I don't pretend that I can do better, and this is not the goal of my capstone project. Through this project, I want evaluate to what extent domain knowledge can improve a basic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on data scraped from the web, and a straightforward approach (based on my limited knowledge of real-estate), I'll work on a first model (that I'll try to improve).\n",
    "Then, I'll work closely with a real-estate professionnal and assess whether I can improve my model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?\n",
    "\n",
    "My client, in this case, is anyone new to data science (either a soon-to-be data scientist or someone trying to understand how to work with data scientists). As I am convinced that an extensive understanding of the problem/domain is key in order to provide a robust model, I will try to provide an example (hopefully a working one).\n",
    "Based on the outcome, I expect the \"clients\" to work mindful, with a strong understanding of the way they interpret the data they use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?\n",
    "\n",
    "As my goal is not to provide a super-accurate model, I don't need tons of data. To get as close as possible to a real-life situation, I'll scrape the data from the web myself. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, I think I'll work with around 500 observations scraped from the web (all relative to a house sold in Belgium). \n",
    "At first, I'll clean the data I need and keep only the features I think are relevant (and where I have enough observations).\n",
    "Then, I'll try to build my model around these (by transforming, scaling, ...). \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Once I have a decent model (for this few data), I'll meet with a real-estate professionnal and try improving my knowledge of this domain. Based on what I'll learn, I'll change the way I use the data as well as my features selection and I'll assess whether I could improve the model or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll deliver the code I used to scrape the data from the web, although it should not be used again as it generates un-necessary web trafic. <br>\n",
    "Also, I'll deliver the code for my models (after and before talking with a real-estate professionnal). These will come with my conclusions (paper)."
